A custom wordpress site for a Hotel Resort

This project uses Bootstrap as a framework with overiding variables to customise the Bootstrap Scss, It uses ACF for building the custom data tables need for the 
custom wordpress tables need for the specific pages and posts. as well as a custom admin section.

The site was developed on local by flywheel for local dev, I just uploaded the theme as ran into issues with uploading the full file.
